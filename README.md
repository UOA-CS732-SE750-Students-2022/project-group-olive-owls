## Explanation

Once your register and login you will see a map of a workplace and bubbles that you can drag and place anywhere on the map to represent where workers will be working.
You are meant to to be able to upload your own map under upload image and it does upload however it doesn't replace the current map in place.

You can explore the multiple pages that exist and add bubbles, employees, records and associations. You can also delete all of these as well as edit some information such as employees

Bubbles that are added are immediately visible on the map once added. 

Authentication is in place users shouldn't be able to access any pages without first logging in or registering
